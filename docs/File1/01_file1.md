## **Pound is emphasis and two astrixes makes it bold**

This is normal text. But there is a way to make it so that extra text has a scroll bar instead of wrapping around. How do you plan for that? Can you figure out that feature?

## Emphasis without bold

~~Does double tilde strike through? Yes but not with spaces~~ 

__ Double undescore does it do something or do we need to... __
<u> do a u surrounding by carrots through html </u>

++ double plus signs ++
== Double equal signs for highlight ==
~Strike through with one tilde~  

Basically some symbols work and some don't. 

> Greater than symbols
> Create this kind of text.

along the tilde key but without shift
` one tick does an inline code segment `
``` Arduino
Triple ticks
does a code block
but it does want a language specified.
```

Can you shrink that smaller in case we had 5000 lines of code?
Do you need to paste code here or could you have a code file?

* do we want bullets
* Then we use 1 astrisk per bullet
* but we can merge with the greater than symbol
